**1. Introduction**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The OpenRTK evaluation kit (EVK) is a hardware platform to evaluate the
    OpenRTK330 GNSS RTK/INS integrated positioning system and develop various
    applications based on this platform. Supported by the online Aceinna Navigation
    Studio the kit provides easy access to the features of OpenRTK330 and
    explains how to integrate the device in a custom design. The OpenRTK 
    EVK is shown below after unpacking.
