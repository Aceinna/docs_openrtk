OpenIMU is a precisely calibrated, open-source Inertial Measurement Unit platform for the development of navigation and localization algorithms.
A free Visual Studio Code (VSCode) extension is installed which contains all the software and tools necessary to create and deploy custom
embedded sensor apps using OpenIMU.  Visual Studio Code is the recommended IDE and the extension configures VS Code to include easy access to compilation, code download, JTAG debug, IMU data logging
as well as OpenIMU platform updates and news.  A developer website called Aceinna Navigation Studio (ANS) includes additional support tools including
a GUI for controlling, plotting and managing data files logged by your Custom IMU.
